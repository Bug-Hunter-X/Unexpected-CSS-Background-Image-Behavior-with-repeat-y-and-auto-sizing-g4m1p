The solution is to remove or modify the `background-size` property.  If you want the image to maintain its aspect ratio while repeating vertically, simply remove `background-size` completely. Alternatively, use a different approach, for example:

```css
div {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
  background-repeat: repeat-y;
  background-size: contain;
}
```

The `background-size: contain;` property allows the image to maintain its aspect ratio and scales it to fit within the container (either by width or height depending on which fits first) while respecting the `repeat-y` setting.  Or you could use `cover` to ensure the whole background is covered.

Another approach, to explicitly specify the width, might be:

```css
div {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
  background-repeat: repeat-y;
  width: 100%; /*Explicit width declaration*/
}
```
This is usually less flexible than contain or cover.
