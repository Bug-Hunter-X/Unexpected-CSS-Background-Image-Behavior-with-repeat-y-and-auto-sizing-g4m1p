The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual error.  The intention is to style an element with a background image that repeats vertically but not horizontally. However, this results in the background not being displayed at all:

```css
div {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
  background-repeat: repeat-y;
  background-size: auto 100%; /*This line is the culprit*/
}
```

The issue arises because `background-size: auto 100%;`  interferes with `background-repeat: repeat-y`.  While intending to set the height to 100% and let the width adjust automatically, this combination prevents the image from being shown, likely because the browser's interpretation of `auto` in this context conflicts with the repetition.
